# Background
I am not a programmer. I do this as a hobby since this is interesting to me. Being an amateur the code for this script is very raw and has plenty of things which can definitely be improved. That said, I am satisfied with how this turned out. Will gladly accept advice/pointers from more experienced people to improve this code. Lets get to it. 

I enjoy the barclays premier league and play the fantasy a lot. One thing I did not like was the fact that you are not able to view detailed history of past seasons. So I started logging everything manually in excel sheets. Decided it would be easier to write a program for it. I chose python since I just started learning it a couple of months ago and the openpyxl module is a way to export data to excel sheets. I'm aware there is a possibility something like this already exists considering the number of 3rd party statistics sites available. But I wanted to make my own script. 

# The Script
Executing the script prompts a GUI interface asking the user to enter their fantasy team ID. This can be found easily on the wesite. Clicking the submit button then proceeds to import all json data from the website and exporting it to excel. 

# The Good
This script exports fantasy premier league gameweek history and player data to excel sheet using the FPL API and json data. I was able to export majority of the data including gameweek average scores, each gameweek squad, the final dream team and transfer history with players' value. The resulting table was then converted into a chart consisting of gameweek score, gameweek average score and points benched. 

# The Bad 
There is a lot of data which is missing at the moment. I was not able to retreive the individual player scores for each gameweek and the captain/vice-captain. No support for mini-leagues and the FPL cup right now. Also weekly dream team is not present.
